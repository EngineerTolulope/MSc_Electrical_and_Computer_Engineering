# Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering
This repository contains my course and research projects from my master's program at UNB. My research project was titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Electrical Load Forecasting," and the goal was to investigate and compare the performance of several load forecasters, including artificial intelligence and deep learning models like CNN, LSTM, and ANN. More information on this research study can be found [here](https://github.com/EngineerTolulope/MSc_Electrical_and_Computer_Engineering/blob/main/Master's%20Dissertation.pdf "Thesis Documentation")
