# Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering
This repository houses my master's program coursework and research projects from the University of New Brunswick. My research project was titled "Deep Learning Techniques for Electrical Load Forecasting," and the goal was to investigate and compare the performance of several load forecasters, including artificial intelligence and deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). More details about this research study can be found [here](https://github.com/EngineerTolulope/MSc_Electrical_and_Computer_Engineering/blob/main/Master's%20Dissertation.pdf "Thesis Documentation").
